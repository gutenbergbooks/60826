<p class='c009'>How to face life, how to prepare for
life, are questions that must be answered
by those who believe, as Lecky put it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>that the “map of life” must be marked
out, that in the words of Emerson there
is such a thing as the “conduct of life”
which man is free to determine.</p>

<p class='c009'>We are assured incessantly in these
days that we must enter upon a great
programme of preparedness for war,—back
of which urging lies the assumption
that a maximum of preparedness
must be arranged in order to secure our
land against the menace of aggression
or invasion. If a programme of preparedness,
which in the last analysis involves
destruction and desolation, be
impossible without the fullest planning,
how much less possible is it to shape a
constructive life-upbuilding programme
without most careful and adequate preparedness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>Into the mind of youth must penetrate
the ideal of self-preparedness,—not of
external preparation for the outward
life, but of inmost preparedness for the
inner life. Whether or not the preparedness
programme be, as some hold,
more menacing to the soul of America
than foreign foe can ever become because
it marks an immediate invasion of
the American soul rather than a possible
aggression upon American soil, it
is certain that life cannot worthily be
lived save after preparedness in the
fullest sense of the term.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is, in truth, easy to stir up excitement
and even deeper feeling over a
purely external problem such as is that
of war-preparedness, preparing to do
something to another whether an individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>or a nation or a continent.
The easiest way is the way of external
preparedness, the militaristic way, for it
involves a minimum of reasoning. But
preparation for life which I ask of
youth involves the largest measure of
reasoning and planning and purposing.
It is the hardest way rather than the
easiest way, though the pursuit thereof
makes ultimately for the way that is
inevitably rightful and unerring.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is it needful to urge upon young people
that they shall face life with the determination
to sketch for themselves a
map of life as they see it, as they purpose,
if so be they purpose, to make it?
What would be said of a military commander
who entered upon a land to him
unknown without securing in advance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>the fullest possible data, without gaining,
as far as it was possible so to do, an
understanding of the outlines of the
country he proposed to enter?</p>

<p class='c009'>Curiously enough, it is often imagined
that preparation for life is
largely a matter of the higher education
and exclusively associated with college
and university life. This imagining
may be due to the circumstance that
men and women step out of so-called
preparatory schools into higher institutions
of learning. One sometimes
wonders, in very truth, whether, instead
of college preparing men for life, it
were not more fitting to hold that after
the college or university experience men
need to be repaired if they are rightly to
live and toil and serve.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>My counsel is not for men alone but
for men and women, for youth and
maidens alike. Let no man venture to
offer two kinds of counsel, one to men
and yet another to women. There is
only one manner of preparedness for
life, for life is life and it is not one
thing for a man and yet another for a
woman.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I have used the term “map
of life,” map is hardly a happy analogy.
For maps presuppose that a land is become
known and familiar. And life
cannot be foreknown and charted, if
life it is to be, as every life ought to be,
a great adventure into the unknown
rather than the acceptance of a programme,
a hazard of the spirit rather
than a body of prescriptions and ordinances.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>We are to fare forth upon the
seas of life,—without chart. But some
of us attempt to sail the sea rudderless,
helmless, starless. Men and women
embark upon life without ever having
given thought to the storms that beset, to
the rocks that threaten, to the unknown
perils that may lie before. And then it
is wondered why many fail to make
port, why the ships of life frequently
founder upon the high seas. The wonder
ought rather to be that so many enter
triumphantly into the harbors of
eternity, seeing how rarely men map out
life in advance, seeing how grudging is
the time spent upon preparation, seeing
how seldom men diligently and consciously
prepare to meet those difficulties
and burdens and problems which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>adequate preparedness for life alone
can fit the soul to face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let not life be mapped out so definitely
for you, so accurately and systematically
that no room will be left for the
play of your own will and the determinations
of your own spirit. I would almost
rather have every map of life flung
away than have life so mapped out as to
leave youth no freedom of choice, as to
fail to spur men on to face the great adventure,
to be capable of daring to front
whatsoever life may offer. Not very
long ago, I inquired of friends, whose
little lad is a pupil of one of the so-called
best schools in the land, when they had
applied for his admittance, and they answered,
“Before he was born.” It occurred
to me to inquire what dire thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>would have happened in the event of the
lad having proved upon birth to be a
little lass, but the comforting assurance
was at once given me that such contingency,
not to say calamity, had been
guarded against, in a sense, through applying
for admittance to a girls’ school
in the event of the lad being born a lass.
It seemed to me then as it does now an
admirable thing to make such comprehensive
provision for a child’s education
as to gain for it in advance of birth admittance
into two schools, irrespective
of sex.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, without resting too heavily upon
this illustration, is it not possible to prepare
another for life so definitely as to
deny to youth the privilege of willing,
choosing, venturing, daring—even losing?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>It were almost better that a youth
go without the problematic advantages
of school discipline than have his school
and college and university career chosen
and marked out for him rigidly and inflexibly.
What greater wrong can I do
my child than to withhold from him the
freedom of choice, than so to cabin and
confine his spirit that he must needs beat
his wings in the intense inane without
knowing the atmosphere that magnifies
freedom and liberates the soul? Guide
if you will the life of youth, but beware
of the danger of maiming and crippling
life through so definitely and completely
mapping it out as to deny the soul of
youth the peril of adventure, the joy
of combat, the glory of hopeless daring.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Life must mean pioneering, not making
one’s way, but breaking a way, clearing
a path of life for one’s self. It is
the glory of life,—and there is no glory
like unto it,—to face the task of moral
and intellectual pioneering. There is
danger lest in our time there pass out of
the life of men one of the most precious
of things, that pioneering spirit that
comes to the man who after he has
fared forth, braved every danger, stood
every peril at bay, declares in the word
of the poet:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Anybody might have heard it</div>
      <div class='line'>But God’s whisper came to me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The whisper of God comes to every
man or to every man it may come. The
opportunity for the performance of the
task of moral or spiritual pioneering is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>denied to no man. Americas of the
spirit remain to be discovered within
the life of every one of us. What man
or woman who may read this will affirm
that there has never come into his life
a revelation the gleam of which enables
him to see that he is free to reach a
great decision, that his spirit may dare
a great refusal, that his soul may utter
a great affirmation? The great moment
of life is that in which a man is
revealed unto himself, in which his soul
is laid bare, in which it comes to him
with the force of a revelation,—mine
is the power to will and to determine
the content of my life, though if I am to
will I must dare to be myself, I must
reach the decision, I must will, I must
be free.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>And the freedom of youth means
freedom to be one’s self, to be a law
unto one’s self, not to be one’s self in
lawlessness. Choose ye this day whom
ye will serve,—remembering that the
responsibility of decision rests with you
and that, in the despite of all the lives
that have been lived and all the maps
that have been drawn and all the plans
that have been sketched and all the precedents
that have been set, you must
live your own life, and, if it be not your
own life, it is not life at all. Cherish
the counsels of loved ones but remember
that neither mother nor father, uncle
nor cousin nor any kinsman or kinswoman
whosoever can choose whom you
are to serve. You cannot serve God
unless yours be the choice.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Young men and women require to be
warned against a thousand and one influences
ever lurking near at hand to deter
youth from the hazard of the spirit’s
pioneering. Despise the counsels of
the over-wise and over-mature, the sum
of whose low wisdom is that a man can
make no graver mistake in life than to
wander from the paths which all men
else have pursued. The fear of seeming
unusual obsesses the soul of too
many of us. Not a few men and women
would rather be wrong than seem
different. Difference, variance, distinctiveness
are not ends in themselves,
but may become and ofttimes are the
means that must be used by him who is
not fearful of moral distinction.</p>

<p class='c009'>Outward differentiation is nothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>but inward distinction is everything,—is
the counsel I ever urge upon my fellow-Jews.
We are not to seem different
for the sake of seeming, but we are
to dare to seem to be different in order
to be distinguished, in order to achieve
spiritual outstandingness. When nice
and refined and timid people say to you,
“Remember to be like everybody else,
don’t attempt anything new, don’t run
the risk of seeming peculiar, don’t
dream of venturing upon novel courses
whether in things great or small,” remember
that there is a possible invasion
of the soul’s integrity that no man need
endure. To the counsels of the timorous
fling back the command to the
brave: “Always do what you are
afraid to do.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>When men seek to affright you by
their counsels of prudence, remind them
of the rule of one of the knightliest of
Americans, the founder of Hampton Institute,
who laid upon one youth’s soul
the burden: “doing what can’t be done
is the glory of living.” And when men
seek to degrade you to the level of their
own base timidity, bid them to remember
the courage and nobleness that were
in the act of Higginson in leading a
negro regiment touching which he said:
“We all fought, for instance, with ropes
around our necks, the Confederate authorities
having denied to officers of
colored regiments the usual privileges
if taken prisoners and having required
them to be treated as felons.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pioneering, moreover, presupposes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>unrest, discontent, just as it should. I
am not fearful for the youth whose soul
is in a state of unrest, the youth who
has soaring ideals and knows not
whether life is even worth living. If
that be his problem it is enough for him
to know, paraphrasing the word of the
Jewish fathers, that whether or not life
is worth living we must live as if it were
and we must make life fuller of worth.
Are you dissatisfied, are you discontented,
so much the better for you.
Hearing from the mother of James
Russell Lowell of his general discontent
with the conditions of society, Emerson
wrote to her, “I hope he will
never get over it.” Better the nobly
discontented than the ignobly content.
Did not John Stuart Mill say that pigs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>are always satisfied and men are always
dissatisfied. But let your discontent and
dissatisfaction be not with the world
but with yourself, knowing that if it
be noble it shall lift you up.</p>

<p class='c009'>Grave consequences attend the too
definite mapping out of life’s programme.
Men’s passion for and faith
in the profession of soldiering rest upon
youth’s yearning for adventure. And
if, perchance, to-day great multitudes of
men are yearning to take up arms, it is
not because they would destroy an enemy,
but because they would obliterate
the emptiness of their own lives, because
they are in revolt against the absence in
normal life to-day of the pioneering opportunity.
It is this lack of stimulus
or impulse in the direction of pioneering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>which makes for poor, mean, low
substitutes in the realm of adventure.
The low gang takes the place of high
comradeship, the debasing fling becomes
a substitute for ennobling adventure.
The passion for glamour and glare, as
disclosed in the craze for the motion
picture, is only another expression of the
thwarted sense of adventure which the
soul of youth dare not be denied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing that the gang spirit is nothing
more than a crude, imperfect, at worst
sinful, expression of youth’s passion for
togetherness, what needs to be done is
to offer youth an opportunity for the
expression of the deep yearning for fraternalism.
Do young men imagine
that they must have their fling? Is it
not because life as lived is often so flat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>and stale and unprofitable that the fling
of the body is substituted for the adventure
of the spirit, that, failing to grasp
hold of the eternal realities and verities,
men set out to magnify the passing and
perishable? When everything big is
shut out of life it is not to be wondered
at that life becomes full of meanness
and littleness and unworthiness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Give yourself to something great, enroll
under the banner of a high cause,
choose as your own some standard of
self-sacrifice, attach yourself to a movement
that makes not for your own gain
but for the welfare of men, and you will
have come upon a richly satisfying as
well as engrossing adventure. Either
your spirit will greatly and bravely,
nobly and self-forgettingly adventure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>or you will be in danger of yielding to
the dominance of your appetites, you
will be in peril of being overcome by
your masterful passions. Dare to give
every power of your life to the furtherance
of a mighty cause. Let your spirit
come under the dominance of a high and
exalting enthusiasm. So will you gain
the mastery over yourself, not as a matter
of prudence, not as a matter of caution,
not as a matter of timidity, not as
a matter of duty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Let something so high and noble
come into your life that it shall be expulsive
of everything low and mean.
The men one honors most, the men one
has reason to cherish most highly, are
those into whose lives something so
lofty and commanding has come as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>have left no room for the mean and
petty. Having given themselves to the
furtherance of a high and exalted ideal,
life leaves no place for the mean. The
selfish and the unworthy retreats with
the precipitancy of the coward before
the imperiousness of the noble impulse,
the divine aim. And to their honor be
it said, young men and women will rise
to the highest level when it invites or
challenges. There is in the heart of
youth a limitless capacity for ardent devotion
to causes of nobleness if but it
be evoked and guided. And youth, too,
understands how noble the venturesome
deed may be even when utterly futile,
how sublime in essence even when
broken and foredoomed.</p>

<p class='c009'>But men cannot finely pioneer nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>nobly adventure until after they have
learned certain lessons in life. Men
must learn to be self-reveringly independent,
which implies not the aloofness
of solitude but the aloneness when
necessary of moral and spiritual self-reliance.
Man must learn to live his
own life. There is no greater danger
in our time than that a man shall submit
to the tyranny of the crowd. A man
need not be remote from nor yet alien to
the world and yet he may live his own
life and live within himself. We suffer
ourselves to come under the domination
of mob-feeling and mob-thinking, such
as it is, because we have not learned
the art of shutting ourselves away at
times from the world. We seem never
to dare to be alone because, though we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>know it not, we would fain avoid facing
life’s problems. We must understand,
too, that, if the problems of our own
life are to be met and solved, these
things cannot be done vicariously. Not
parents nor teachers nor ministers can
solve those pressing problems of our inner
life with which a man can cope effectively
only amid the solitude of his
inmost life. Until you have learned the
art of separating yourself for some time
in every day from the multitude, you
will not learn how to think out and think
through life’s problems. You will not
even know that there are problems to be
resolved.</p>

<p class='c009'>But while life is to be lived in the
spirit of self-reverence and self-reliance,
life’s great questions cannot be faced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>aright unless they be faced selflessly.
Life is not to be egocentric but heterocentric.
The question that a man
must put is not what is he going to
get out of life, how can he get the
most out of life, but how can he put
the most and the best into life. Life
is not to be interpreted in terms of
self, of individual gain, of personal advantage.
If it be possible to differentiate
between two classes in the world,
these classes are respectively made up
of the men who read life in the language
of privilege and advantage and the men
who interpret life in the terms of duty
and obligation and responsibility. The
selfless are the only beings who know
how to live, who have learned and mastered
the art of life. It is always possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>to draw the distinction between the
man who lives for himself, for what he
can get out of life, for the enhancement
of his own fame, for the enlargement of
his own power, and the man who puts
himself second, who lives for the good
of others, who lives for the good, who
is capable of denying self. The noblest
of men and women are they who prescribe
life to self in terms of duty to the
world.</p>

<p class='c009'>I venture to say to youth this day
that there are two great needs in the
life of youth, if life is to be truly and
finely faced. Have an ideal, something
to live by, and live for that ideal,
wholly, steadfastly, unwaveringly.
Many men are willing to cherish an
ideal, to behold a vision, to catch a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>gleam, but they do not seem to understand
that ideals are not to be had
cheaply, that a vision is not to be gained
for the asking. One comes upon men
and women in every walk of life entirely
ready to pursue an ideal, but the pursuit
must impose no difficulty, must involve
no sacrifice. These are the idealists
who falter not until sacrifice be demanded
of them, and then their ideal is
suffered to pass as if the ideal were
nothing more than a fair-weather friend
rather than a refuge in time of trouble,
a bulwark during hours of trial and
amid the storms of temptation.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nor are ideals reserved for the great
and outstanding in life. Every one of
us has a goal, and you are what your
goal is. Your life will ultimately define
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>itself in the terms of your ideal.
Let your ideal be high and it will exalt
you. Suffer your ideal to be low and
it will be sure to debase you. You are
your goal: your ideal is you. Life often
breaks down here, in one of these
two critical places, in the matter of willing
highly and of having holily. Some
men have neither vision of goal nor
choice of way. Some men have the
vision but stumble on the way,—the
men who think the goal more important
than the way, forgetting that the way is
the goal. And so many falter and fumble,
forgetting that life’s most important
choice is as truly of a path as of the
goal, that the way that leads thither is
of the essence of the dream and the
triumph. What thou wouldst have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>highly thou must have holily. We will
to have high things, but we are not prepared
to achieve them holily, as if the
manner of the quest were less holy than
the matter of the goal.</p>

<p class='c009'>Who does not know of men in business
who aim to secure a competence
and are resolved to put by the ways that
are sharp and mean, after a fortune has
been secured? Men vainly imagine that
after they have amassed much they will
neutralize the evil they have done by
doing much good, but in the meantime
they have done evil to themselves and
are no longer free to live by the ideal.
Giving themselves unholily to the quest
of the high, they have become transformed
and debased into something
mean and strange. One knows of men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>in the ministry to whom is given the
putatively wise counsel to be discreetly
cautious and evasively silent until the
time comes for the occupancy of a great
pulpit, when, as it is basely said, a man
can afford to speak out of his soul. But
when the great pulpit prize is won, the
gleam, alas, is gone, the vision lies shattered.
The man has been corrupted
and his soul corroded and he who was
willing for a time to be silent in the
hope that some day, through the methods
of silence, he might achieve the
right of speaking out more bravely, has
in the meantime become a dumb dog
who has lost the power as well as the
will to utter himself in fashion brave
and unafraid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seemingly good men, outwardly decent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>men enter into political life and imagine
that they must for a time strike
hands with corruption until the hour will
come when they shall be able to smite
corruption with their own fists. They
palter and they falter, whispering sorrowfully,
“Truly it is regrettable, but
one must do these things.” One distinguished
statesman in American life
declared to a friend many years ago
that there are times when a man must
eat a peck of dirt in order to gain high
office. He gained the office, he ate his
peck, and the tragedy is that it is not
only become the steady article of his
diet, but he loves it and he would not
live without it, that it is become of the
very essence of his being.</p>

<p class='c009'>In other words, a man cannot wallow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>through the mire to the skies. No man
can have two standards, one to be followed
until he be forty or fifty, and then
suddenly put away. No man can divest
himself of the lower ideal which he has
adopted as a temporary expedient, because
in the meantime it has come to
have the mastery over his soul. Putting
aside the great choice, the hour
comes when a man finds himself incapable
of the great refusal and the standard
to which he gave his temporary adherence,
to be abandoned in the years
of opulence and safety, becomes his despotic
and inescapable master. It is no
more possible to have two standards in
the world of the spirit than it is possible
to prescribe two different moral standards
for men and women. Unity must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>be sought and achieved at the outset,
not a lowered standard in the beginning
and a higher standard in the end. The
habit of the soul cannot be altered at
will. Once to every man and not a
thousand times comes the moment to
decide, and the earlier decision will in
part, if not in whole, be determinative
of every later choice.</p>

<p class='c009'>And if, young men and women, there
were nothing else for which to prepare,
there is the future, there is the holy calling
of parenthood to be pursued by most
of you. Have I not the right to appeal
to young men and women to-day to remember
how much or how little they
can make of their own lives, and may
we not base such appeal upon the truth
that they are to be the makers and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>molders of the morrow; that unless
their lips and lives proclaim the voice of
God in the soul of man, there will follow
a little-souled and mean-hearted generation
instead of a race of great-hearted
and noble-souled men and women.</p>

<p class='c009'>A beautiful passage in an allegory
recently presented upon the stage tells
of the song of unborn souls, which are
dreaming of the parenthood to be their
lot upon earth and looking forward with
heavenly joy to the supreme felicity and
benediction of parenthood. The most
important duty of youth is to prepare
with consciousness and consecration for
life’s highest duty,—the duty of parenthood.
Shall that future be polluted,
shall that heritage be befouled? In reminding
young men and women as I do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that they are the trustees of the morrow,
that they hold in their keeping the destiny
of all the future, I am tempted to
ask a question. What if I were to
bring a little child before you, some
beautiful child of a year or two, and
what if some man sitting in this company
were to come hither and for some
unknown reason strike that child:
would it not be with difficulty that
we could restrain ourselves from doing
violence to such a creature? What
of the men and women committing
a crime infinitely more hurtful, who
would not strike a little child, but who,
none the less, are ready to doom unborn
generations to a heritage of evil, of
hurt, of shame? What young man or
woman will not think upon that?</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>A further word should be spoken to
young women who in every generation
are standard-bearers, and not only
standard-bearers but standard-lifters. I
know it to be true that ofttimes women
conform to the lower standards which
men impose upon them. Yet is it true
that women may be the makers of standards
if they will, and that, if they consent
to the lowering of the standards,
men will readily and, alas, eagerly lapse
to the lower levels. Will not young
women understand that, if they suffer
standards to be lowered, if they for any
reason yield to the temptation to be
their poorer, unworthier selves in the
sight of men, then will they corrupt men,
then will they in very truth have broken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>faith with the moral order which has
vested womanhood with the supreme
privilege of exalting standards and by
the exalting of standards exalting men.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have said nothing up to this time
about the place of God in the life of
youth. I never feel it my duty to urge
you to believe in God as if faith in God,
as if trust in God, as if the acceptance
of God were a task to be superimposed
rather than a privilege to be coveted.
To young men and women I would say
that the one thing in the world they may
not omit to do is to leave room for God
in their lives. But you cannot leave
room for God if your life be choked
and clogged with things, and things, and
things. Leave a place in your life for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the spirit of God and God will find his
way into your life and lead you to the
making of a life divine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reviewing what has gone before, the
great thing in life is to map it out in
youth. Not that one is to refrain from
venturing upon the uncharted sea but
that, howsoever daringly one is ready
to fare forth upon the seas, one may not
forget the guidance of the stars. It is
a great thing to venture upon the imperiling
seas of life without the assurance
of safety and reward for one’s
plans and toils. It is a greater thing
so to fare forth as to come inevitably
under the direction of the fixed stars in
the heavens of the spirit divine.</p>

<p class='c009'>Upon a stained window in the dwelling
of a noble friend I came upon some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>lines which I commend to the soul of

  <h2 class='c006'>II <br /> <br /> <span class='c007'>MATURITY: HOW TO SERVE AND ACHIEVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='sc'>Maturity</span>, or the middle period of
life, is in a sense the largest part of
life, and is not to be viewed merely as
the period after youth and before old
age. It is relative only as all time is
relative, but it is absolute, too. In
truth, it is the time of that self-dependence
which comes with the consciousness
of power in maturity. It is the very
body and substance of life and least relative,—for
youth is its foreshadowing
and old age the shadow which it casts
behind. Middle age is not a link between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>youth and old age, but that period
of life to which youth is an approach,—from
which old age is an exit. Comparing
life to a bridge, youth and old
age might be likened to the piers which
must be builded, but the linking together
of the piers, the stretching of the cables
over which the larger part of life’s pilgrimage
must be made is the task of
life’s middle period.</p>

<p class='c009'>Life is so constituted that it were almost
within the limits of reasonableness
to urge that life need not pass out of
the middle stage into old age. Loath
though one be to enter upon maturity,
it need never be left behind in return
for age if it be entered upon in the spirit
of preparedness. Middle age is hard
and bitter if youth have been misspent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>if youth have not been the stage of conscious
preparation for life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certain rules have been laid down for
the governance of youth and the question
may be asked whether these are
pertinent to the needs and tasks of middle
age,—namely the law that one must
have an ideal by which to live, and that
one must not merely live by it but up to
it. As for the rules which are to be
binding upon the middle period of life,
who shall venture to prescribe them,
save that certain things are obviously
true,—that middle age shall continue
that which youth initiates, and that there
shall be no sharp frontier dividing
youth from that which comes after.
For middle age is not so much a part of
life as it is life, and life absolute.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Middle age is but a part of the same
life-long journey which in its early
stages is youth, which culminates in age.
And yet in a sense a different type of
rules and ordinances is applicable to
every one of the three great periods of
life. For life is not a journey, even and
unvarying, over a wide plain. Life
may best be likened to the ascent of a
mountain and in turn the descent from
its summit, and the laws that govern
life must be variously modified in order
to meet the needs of the different periods
along the journey.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the early stages, during the hours
of the ascent, the imperative thing is
that a man shall not over-tax his
strength, that he shall not overstrain
his powers in the initial stages of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>journey, that he shall not attempt too
much, that he shall not travel at too
wearying a pace. As man nears the
summit of the mountain, it becomes
needful for him to conform to other
rules. He must not lose the stride, he
must know how to go on, he must climb
and climb without succumbing to the
heat of the day. Once the descent is
begun, yet other rules apply, if one is
with safety to reach the end of the long
journey. The glory of the morning no
longer upbears him, the splendor of the
noonday sun no longer maintains his
strength. But as he leaves youth’s
vigor and the power of maturity behind
him, the glow of the passing day may
irradiate his vision and reveal to him
the distant horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Middle age seems too often a painful
reluctance to leave youth behind and to
be a more painful hesitancy in the matter
of facing the oncoming of age. Unhappily
for itself, middle age oft combines
the childishness of immaturity
with the senescence of post-maturity so
that it lacks alike the charm of youth
and the grace of age. Old age that is
not worthy of reverence is contemptible.
Not less worthy of contempt is middle
age, if it have brought from youth
nothing save youth’s foibles and frailties.
We not unseldom see—and it is
always a pitiful spectacle,—men and
women whose bark of life is unballasted
by the poise that comes with strength
and unsteadied by the serenity which
ought to be the mark of the maturer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>period. While men speak of the dignity
of old age, it is in truth the middle
age which is in need of dignity, which
alas it too often lacks.</p>

<p class='c009'>Men frequently refer to the emptiness
and the barrenness of old age, when
it is oftenest middle age that is empty
and meaningless, for it is the time when
life’s emptiness is disclosed. It is in
middle age that men are made to face
the bitter truth that theirs is not to
achieve and to serve because they have
not set up any standards worthy of the
name, because their goal, such as it is, is
too immediately accessible, and they cannot
serve because self, having been their
very deity, has not suffered them to will
to serve or to learn how to serve.</p>

<p class='c009'>The temptation of middle age is to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>yield to the spirit of disenchantment,
though verily that is oft-times called
disenchantment which means nothing
more than the absence of enchantments.
The temptation of middle age is not so
much to give up ideals as to realize that
one is without them. Then men mistake
their poor plans and plottings, their
puny purposes for ideals and wonder
why they have lost that which in truth
they never had. Men rarely lose
ideals. Poor, imperfect substitutes for
ideals are found out and find out their
owners,—if so they may be named.
Men are not to fear losing ideals in middle
age. They are to fear not having
them in youth so that they cannot hold
them throughout life.</p>

<p class='c009'>Middle age depends upon youth, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>its disillusionments are due chiefly to
the absence of illusions in the time of
youth. In middle and in old age men
suddenly discover that they cannot reap
what in youth they have failed to sow.
That middle age finds the ideals of
youth unsatisfying and even unengrossing,
indicts only youth and not itself,
shows that the map of life, if drawn at
all and as drawn in youth, was not ample
and generous enough to have proved
sufficing for a lifetime.</p>

<p class='c009'>Assuming that middle age is less joyous
than youth, it enjoys one supreme
satisfaction, or rather reaps one supreme
compensation, that of the consciousness
of two powers, two of life’s
sovereign powers, the power to achieve
and the power to serve. If youth initiates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>middle age most achieves and
best serves,—most achieves because it
is a time of fullness of intellectual
strength and firmness of moral will; best
serves because the stains of self have
been or ought to have been burnt out
and there is left the capacity of selfless
enlistment under banners unrelated to
personal gain or private advantage.
The middle age that men find bare and
unsatisfying is in truth that to them who
have not mastered the two arts of life,
achieving and serving.</p>

<p class='c009'>Certain mistakes are not uncommon
in respect of the interpretation of middle
age, for example, that it is not the
period of high initiative. Because
things are not initiated with dash and
flare, it is assumed that middle age undertakes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>nothing. On the contrary, it
is then and perhaps only then that things
are begun and achieved for their own
sake, that things are really undertaken
in the consciousness of strength and with
a capacity for achievement. Moreover,
while little can be carried into and
beyond middle age that is not initiated
in youth, the soul of man has not in the
middle period forfeited or abandoned
the power of self-correction and self-redemption.
It may not be easy,
neither is it impossible.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps the supreme rule for middle
age may be phrased in the fewest of
words,—<i>don’t stop growing</i>! Physical
and intellectual maturity are not interchangeable
terms. The truth is that
men almost consciously cease to grow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>and even will not to grow at thirty-five
and forty and forty-five and then proceed
to wonder why life is so unsatisfying.
Let men but remember that there
is no such thing as maturity in life,—if
maturity mean the cessation of growth,—for
maturity were followed by post-maturity,
which is over-ripeness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Men need never cease to grow and
mature. Men will either grow up or
go down. The great and satisfying
lives are those of men and women who
grow on and go on until they are cut
down. When Freeman died, he asked
that on his gravestone be carved the
words, “He died learning.” He who
grows and learns dies not. Continue,
as long as thou wouldst grow, to learn
and reason and purpose, nor yet imagine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>that life is done when youth is ended.
Nor let the middle-aged forget that going
on is not the only possibility. Even
in middle age a man may reserve for
himself freedom, freedom of choice,
freedom to revise life’s foundations,
freedom to begin anew if so be error
have been made.</p>

<p class='c009'>Above all, middle age must not lose
its admirations, its reverences, its enthusiasms.
The edge of enthusiasm
may be dulled with the passing of the
years,—but the body and substance of
one’s admirations need not be diminished,
and by our admirations we live.
Anatole France, speaking of the old
campaigners of the Reserve, uses this
finely stimulating word with regard to
them,—“they unite the elasticity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>youth with the staunchness of maturity.”
There is another and an older way of
describing the characteristic quality of
middle age, which must combine “the
wisdom of age and the heart of youth.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span><span class='sc'>Old</span> age depends largely upon the attitude
of men toward the whole of life.
Old age is not a joke nor a bore nor a
trial nor a calamity, though it may be
any one of these as all of life may be.
But what needs to be stressed is that old
age has no content in itself apart from
the whole of life. Old age may be as
nothing else a foretaste of the kingdom
of heaven where faith and hope may
meet and love crown all. But little can
come to old age that was not in and
throughout life. Alas for the old age
of the self-centered and self-serving!
If life have built walls that shut out,
these cannot be razed by age, which will
forever have made itself captive.</p>

<p class='c009'>The crown of old age is a term that
trips lightly from our tongues. Are we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>not in danger of forgetting that there
must be something to crown? For in
old age inheres no magic to redeem and
transfigures all that has gone before.
Old age purges the precious metal of
life’s substance of its debasing dross,
but the precious substance must be there
to be purged. Age, like happiness, is
neither to be sought nor evaded. It is
a by-product of life rather than life’s
end. Not the aim nor goal of life, but
the way of life must it be.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the matter of reverencing old age,
we rest historically upon the firmest
Jewish foundation. For the Jew as no
other man before or after him taught
the world how to magnify childhood
and to glorify old age,—to rise up before
the hoary head and honor the face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>of the old man. And this revering solicitude
for the aged is still one of the
marks of Jewish life. Jewish teaching
has urged and Jewish practice has confirmed
the truth that blessing rests upon
that home in which the aged have found
shelter.</p>

<p class='c009'>Indeed, one is almost disposed to hold
that there is a possibility of overdoing
reverence for old age as old age, of becoming
indiscriminating in the honor
which one metes out to the hoary head.
If the people of Israel have erred in
any part with respect to old age, they
have revered the aged head too much
irrespective of the head and the man.
I would not if I could break with that
fine tradition, but, sometimes, it were
well to ask whether old age is to be respected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>as a virtue in itself, whether
length of days should be regarded as a
merit apart from what has gone before.
Old age is judged compassionately on
the principle that nothing but the good
should be spoken touching the dead or
the nearly dead.</p>

<p class='c009'>One is sometimes moved to believe
that if the aged are unhappy it is because
age brings with it not only opportunity
for quiet meditation and serene
retrospect, but the necessity of thinking
about the great issues of life. And
many of us have never learned how to
think. We have put off the evil day of
taking thought upon life so that, when
it at last comes, its imminence appalls.
Men and women put off their questions
and their problems to the end of life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>and when the end is nearly come, they
lack the strength and will to think them
through. The need of solutions is then
cruelly pressed upon unpracticed and
undisciplined minds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I ask the question, how to
grow old and how not to grow old, are
we not, if we will be frank, more
interested in the question how not to grow
old than how to grow old? In the
question, pressing a little farther, how
to seem not to grow old rather than how
not grow old? Seeming not to grow
old may be attained by artificial means.
Not to grow old may be achieved by
inward grace alone. Need it be said
that no one is ever deceived by external
methods of averting age, nor is any one
profited or helped save perhaps the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>chemist and the dye-maker, save the
babblers and praters of new substitutes
for old faiths? Whosoever thinks of
old age aright, whosoever has fitted
himself for the dignity of the burden of
many days will resort neither to renewing
cosmetics nor novel cults as a refuge
from old age.</p>

<p class='c009'>Men speak of the penalties of old
age and penalties there are, but what of
its rewards, rich and abundant and
wondrous, richer indeed in most cases
than its desert? The old, because they
are old, are treated for the most part
as if they were travelers returning
richly laden with stores of varied
treasures from a voyage over remotest
seas to some strange and wondrous spot.
Old age in itself is no more a reward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>than a penalty. And yet what rewards,
paraphrasing Shakespeare, accompany
old age, and how fitting that these rewards,
friendship-bearing, honor-bringing,
should wait upon what might elsewise
be life’s melancholy end!</p>

<p class='c009'>The truth is that old age is not a
period of rewards nor penalties in themselves.
It is a time of duties, as every
period offers life’s cup with duties
brimming o’er. Duties there are,—but
there are privileges beyond estimate.
And the privilege of privileges is to offer
an example to others in all ways and
most of all in the way of facing life
with serenity. Finer far for old age to
claim its duties than to enjoy its privileges
for the old ought to shun being
pitied as weak and seek rather to be admired
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>as strong and honored as
serene.</p>

<p class='c009'>When old age has the grace of exalting
duty and subordinating privilege,
it ceases to be the period of mute resignation.
From one point of view, it is
the age of resignation, for one wittingly
resigns in part what death is wholly to
take away, but, be it made clear, resignation
is not inaction, renunciation is not
willlessly surrendering torpor. These
things imply will, action, choice, not
merely an awaiting of the end without
murmur or complaint. For old age
waits not but wills; old age surrenders
not but whilst life is renders return for
life.</p>

<p class='c009'>While different types of laws seem to
obtain for youth, maturity and old age,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>these yet are one and one spirit seems
to pervade and dominate all. Let
youth hold high its aim and pursue high
aims through holy means. Let maturity
serve and achieve and above all
achieve only that it may serve with
unimpaired admiration and undimmed
ideals. And let old age be nobly wise
and unafraid and unselfish to the end!</p>

<p class='c009'>Much, if not everything, of the content
of old age depends on the things for
which one cares. If one care for the
things that cannot survive youth or middle
age, whose value is inevitably lessened
with the flight of years, then old
age must become barren and empty.
Whether your old age is to be void and
meaningless depends almost wholly not
upon what you have and care for at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>seventy or eighty, but what it was you
sought to have at twenty, what you
cared for at thirty, what you cherished
at forty. Certain things may be harmless,
even admirable in themselves, and
yet are destined to be woefully disappointing
if they are suffered to become
the pursuits of a lifetime and men give
themselves to things for which they cannot
care when the years have multiplied.</p>

<p class='c009'>Myopia may interfere with one’s zest
for looking upon motion pictures, limbs
may become too rheumatic for dancing,
tragic though this may sound, the hazard
of games of chance may lose its
fascination, even money-making, the
accumulation of things, may pall or become
impossible. But certain things
there are that can never grow stale nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>wearying nor seem unprofitable. Upon
these let men fix their vision and their
aim, the pleasures of the mind, the tasks
of the spirit, the possibilities of serving.
It is almost life’s greatest danger that
life will be lived with care for things
interest in which cannot survive youth
and middle age. What if a man were
so to train himself physically that he
could run and do nothing else, so that
after the period of running had passed,
he could not walk! Would not such
modus vivendi seem unwise and sadly
blundering?</p>

<p class='c009'>Would you avoid growing old? Do
you will even to seem not to grow old?
Then have a vision of life and amid a
multiplicity of things have and hold,
cherish and pursue an ideal. To the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>man of ideals, to the man who in other
words lives, age comes not. Age cannot
touch nor wither nor blast the life
pervaded and smitten through by ideals.
Would you grow old, or rather would
you not grow old, then live, and live by
the stars. Such are the lives of the
unaging. In order not to grow old, I
say again, grow on in faith and hopefulness,
in vision and serviceableness.
Being without these things, some men
cannot grow old, they are old. Unhappily
for them, they were born old, as
other men, whatever be the number of
their years, die young. Having these
things, age cannot ravage the spirit.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such men and women are age-proof,
their heads may be silver white, their
frames bowed, their limbs palsied, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>age they know not,—the men I have in
mind, such men as that great physician
who, after sixty years and more of
unwearied and unrivaled service, is still
an impassioned pleader for the right of
the child, of the merest, puniest babe.
Who will dare say that he is aged, who
at fourscore and more spends himself
utterly in the service of the least of
these? I am thinking of yet another
friend of fourscore and more, whose
life is nobly dedicated to the furtherance
of amity between faith and faith, who
serves all men as brothers, who proves
that he is a Christian by the love he
bears the Jew. And I am thinking of
yet another man who likewise has lived
for fourscore years, perhaps the foremost
educator of our generation, a publicist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>of matchless felicity in utterance
and conduct alike, a man who at eighty
and more steps into the arena with all
the power and eagerness of youth in
order to take up arms on behalf of another
great though much wronged servant
of the nation.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was once said of Theodore Parker
that he gave himself unreservedly and
with abandon to whatever truth, duty,
love, the three sublime voices of God,—the
real trinity in our souls,—commanded.
Truth, duty, love! Have
you tried these things? Have you
dared to live by them and for them, by
and for any one of them? Does not
this word bear out what was recently
said by a great American physician
about a noble social worker,—that individual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>who has no object in life, who
simply works day by day, with the idea
that he is making a dollar and is going
to use the dollar for his own comfort,
cannot have a very peaceful mind. But
if one has an object in life, to attain
certain things which will be helpful to
others, and whose day is filled with that
sort of work, that individual deserves,—and
other things being equal,—will
have an old age.</p>

<p class='c009'>Truth, duty, love,—obey their command
and when you do you shall find
age a fiction and life alone a reality.
What if old age be without teeth and
eyes if it be not without hope and faith
and fadeless memories!</p>

<p class='c009'>If then life be centered on self, old
age may rest in the certitude of
disappointment and disillusion. But if self
be centered on life, then may come what
Morley described, touching Edmund
Burke, as “an unrebellious temper and
hopes undimmed for mankind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Twofold must be the hope of man,—for
a future for self and for the future
for all. And when the soul is so
freighted with hopes, then shall it be
said of a man as it was said of the great
poet: “He was one of those on the
lookout for every new idea and for
every old idea with a new application,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>which may tend to meet the growing requirements
of society; one of those who
are like men standing on a watch-tower
to whom others apply and say, not
‘What of the night?’ but ‘What of the
morning and of the coming day?’”</p>

<p class='c009'>My one word of counsel is,—let life
not be centered on self, for to live for
self is to invite cruel disaster in old age.
The saddest, in truth the most tragic,
lives I know are those of old men and
women who have nothing to live for because
they have lived for self and self
alone,—and self is nothing. Their
lives are piteously empty. For the
restlessness and excitement of youth
may hide this truth, but age, like death,
is a revealer. And there are many
types of selfishness. I speak of two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>which must suffice. There are those
who live for self,—for selfissimus, giving
not the utmost for the highest but
all for the nighest,—self, self, self,
self’s pleasure and profit and power and
vantage and fame. These are the most
crude and obvious types of the selfful,
who shall pay the penalty of their folly
and their moral disease.</p>

<p class='c009'>But, though it be said to your dismay,
there are other types of selfishness,
though less obvious,—the selfishness of
those who project self into and magnify
self in family relationship. For there
are those who simply extend the horizon
of self enough to include other forms of
self, one’s own, one’s nearest, one’s flesh
and blood. And here, too, disillusion
is bound to come and ought to come, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>one’s own cannot and ought not to fill
one’s life forever. One might well excuse
our mothers and fathers for giving
their thought and attention to their own,
for these were many and life was hard
and life’s struggle ofttimes bitter. But
for the fewest is such excuse valid now,—if
ever it was valid—especially seeing
that we concentrate upon the giving
to others of things rather than upon
helping others to their highest and best.
In truth, people concentrate upon self,
upon their own interests and wishes, and
these things pass and little or nothing
is left in life save self. Live for yourself,
and you live two years in one; live
in the life of others, and you divide your
years with another.</p>

<p class='c009'>Is not all this a paraphrase of what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Emerson has said better than any other?
He who loves is in no condition old.
Not lives and lives for self, not loves
self and self alone, but he who loves!
Emerson, building better perhaps than
he knew, has voiced the deepest truth of
the soul. Love cannot die and love will
not let die nor yet grow old. And yet
as a final word, and more needed than
all else, I would say that there is only
one way to grow old, and that too is the
only way not to grow old. That way is
to know, to love, to serve.</p>
